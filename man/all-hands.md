Well, Brayns is a powerful software.
But it has the reputation of being a little bit scary, isn't it?

This time is over!
Because we are creating this new web interface, which will make it more **user-consumable**.

Use cases are first citizen in this application.

Here is an example called **Anterograde Highlighter**.  
Just enter a list of cell's IDs and it will highlight the afferent or efferent neurons.  

All this without the need of writing a single line of Python code.

Another use case deals with circuit simulations.

It is now easy to produce a movie from your simulation.

For this, you will use what we have called **key frames**.

Key frames will record the camera position and the simulation step.
