So, Brayns is a powerful software that allows us to see big circuits.  
But it used to be a bit scary.

That's why, we will now focus on making it more **user-consumable**.

And for that, we have created this new web interface.  
It provides user-friendly features, like
* this file browser,
* a smarter circuit loader, ...

Use cases are first citizen of this application.

Here is an example called **Anterograde Highlight** that makes it easy to see connected neurons.

And you can also make your own movies of simulations.
