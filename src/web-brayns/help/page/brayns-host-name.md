# How to get a Brayns' Host Name?

Open a terminal (`Ctrl-Alt-T`) and execute this command:

```
/gpfs/bbp.cscs.ch/home/petitjea/scripts/allocate.sh proj42
```
_You can replace `proj42` by another account._


You will get something like this output:

```
[INFO ] Rockets server running on r1i4n35:5000
```

In this example, the host name you need is  
__`r1i4n35`__.`bbp.epfl.ch`:`5000`
