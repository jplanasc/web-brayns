# Introduction to Web-Brayns

## Loading a Circuit

Click on the "Load a Model" button to open the file explorer.
Folders are shown on the left side, files on the right.

If the chosen file is a Circuit in a format supported by Brayns, it will show you this dialog.

There are several options:

* Let's start with the density.
    The density allows you to control the amount of cells that will be displayed, in percentage units.
    Circuits can have a very large number of cells.
    Brain tissue is very compact. If you load everything, the resulting image can be so dense that you won't be able to differentiate the neurons.
    Another issue will be the loading time. The more cells Brayns has to load, the more time it will take.
    As an example, for huge circuits (with hundred of thousands of neurons), the loading time can last hours.
    So, if you look at a circuit for the first time, it is better to load it with a very low density for a quick validation.
* A neuron consists of a cell body (the soma), dendrites and a single axon.
    You can choose to load the full morphology (that is all parts of the neuron), and that is what you will in most cases.
    But for huge ones, it is better to start by only loading the somas.
* We will come back to explain the reports and targets sections later.

Then click the "load" button and wait for the progress bar to complete.

The circuit will appears as a new model in the list you can see on the left.
In this list, you can

* show/hide a model...
* delete a model...
* focus on a model (by clicking the "aim" button)...
* and get more tools behind the "ellipsis" button (the three dots just here)...

## Moving the "camera" around

Brayns is a like a microscope with a tiny camera you can move around.

You have three possible moves:

1. __Zooming in and out__.
    You can use you mouse wheel, or the two fingers up and down gesture on Mac.
    If the speed is not enough, hold the Shift key.
    On the contrary, if you need to move slowly, hold the Ctrl key.
2. __Orbiting around the model center__.
    Just drag the mouse around, holding the left button.
    You will turn around the selected model.
    To select another model, just click on it in the models' list.
3. __Up, right, down and left translation__.
    Move the mouse accordingly, holding the right mouse button.
    If you have only one mouse button, hold the Ctrl key instead.
